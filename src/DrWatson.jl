\nUpdate message: DrWatson v$update_version

[BREAKING] The function `projectdir` as well
as its derivatives like `datadir` have changed their internals to use
`joinpath` and in general promote the healthier usage of `joinpath`.
This means that their return value no longer end in "\"!.
This will likely break usage of e.g. `datadir` that used `*`, like it was
suggested in the old (unhealthy) documentation. We are very sorry
for this inconvenience!

[NEW] New funtion `parse_savename` that reverse-engineers the output
of `savename`!
